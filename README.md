# Hippo Folder Context Menus

This project provides extra Folder Context Menu items such as 'Copy folder...' and 'Move folder...'
for Hippo CMS with extensible base implementations for developers.

# Documentation 

Documentation is available at [onehippo-forge.github.io/folder-context-menus](https://onehippo-forge.github.io/folder-context-menus)

The documentation is generated by this command:

```bash
$ mvn clean site
```

The output is in the docs directory; push it and GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically.
